This is an implementation of Compressed Sensing reconstruction for MRI data.
It implements the non-linear conjugate sub-gradient algorithm as described in 
the paper "Sparse MRI: The Application of Compressed Sensing for Rapid MR Imaging", 2007
Magn Res Med, In Press.


The code is not optimized and is given for educational purpose.

The demos implement some of the examples given in the paper. More examples
will be added in time. 

demo_SheppLoganTV.m  demonstrate the example first presented by Candes romberg and Tao.

demo_angio_simulation.m demonstrates a simulation of an angiography-like phantom

demo_angio.m demostrates a reconstruction of 3DFT ssfp T2-prep angio data that was 2-fold undersampled

demo_SheppLoganTV_vdSpiral.m  demostrates how to use non-Cartesian trajectories. For this, you
				MUST have Jeffery Fessler's min-max NUFFT code.
				(http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html)


demo_Brain_2D.m  demonstrate an L1-wavelet reconstruction of a brain image.
		 In order to try this demo, you need to install Wavelab
		 (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/)



demo_phantom_denoising.m demonstrates CS reconstruction in the presence of noise


demo_thresholding.m Demonstrates the sparsity of images by the thresholding experiment as described
			in the paper.



*** This is a first rough draft of the code. More examples/documentation will be added in time ***
*** We tried as much a possible to make sure that all the functions that are needed are present ***
*** However, if you are missing some, please contact Miki.                                       ***
